# Edit the name of the pool and dataset you wish
# to snapshot. This can be the entire pool, e.g. 
# DATASET=pool
# Where pool is the name of your ZFS pool
# Or, a dataset within the pool, e.g.
# DATASET=pool/test
DATASET=pool/test

# *** DO NOT EDIT AFTER THIS LINE ***

# Get today date and time for snapshot name
# As YearMonthDayHourMinute
CDATE=`date +"%Y%m%d%H%M"`


# Check if hour snapshot is required
# Clean up oldest snapshot:

# Get counter
# Checks if regular file exists
COUNTER=count
if [ -f "$COUNTER" ]; then
# Get last backup number

LASTNUMBER=$(head -n 1 $COUNTER)

echo $LASTNUMBER

# Could not find counter file
# Fatal error quits
